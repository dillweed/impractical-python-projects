# Finding Palingram Spells

Practice project 02 from [Impractical Python Projects](https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects)

## Objective

> In this chapter, you’ll load dictionary files from the internet and use Python to discover first palindromes and then the more complex palingrams in those files. Then you’ll use a tool called cProfile to analyze your palingram code so that you can make it more performant. Finally, you’ll sift through the palingrams to see how many have an “aggressive” nature.
